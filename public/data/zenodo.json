Auch in sozial- und bildungswissenschaftlichen Kontexten werden RCTs genutzt, um Effekte von Interventionsinstrumenten nachzuweisen.</p>\n\n<p>Seit dem letzten Jahrzehnt gewinnt die Programmiersprache R fach&uuml;bergreifend zunehmend an Bedeutung. Durch seinen Open Source-Charakter und durch die kollaborative Entwicklung zahlreicher funktionaler Erweiterungen (sogenannter &quot;packages&quot;) stellt die R-Infrastruktur heute eines der vielseitigsten, flexibelsten und innovativsten Instrumentarium zur statistischen Auswertung wissenschaftlicher Daten dar. Auch au&szlig;erhalb des akademischen Kontexts gewinnt R zunehmend an Bedeutung. Der Erwerb von Kenntnissen der Programmiersprache ist daher, unabh&auml;ngig von Fachrichtung und weiterer Karriereplanung, ein meist sinnvolles Investment.</p>\n\n<p>In vorliegendem Workshop soll eine Einf&uuml;hrung in die statistische Evaluation randomisiert-kontrollierter Studien unter Nutzung von R gegeben werden. Fokussiert wird hierbei auf die Vermittlung eines konzeptuellen Verst&auml;ndnisses statistisch-methodischer Grunds&auml;tze und Techniken bei der Auswertung prospektiver, parallel-randomisierter Studien und Experimente. Die Teilnehmenden sollen nach dem Workshop wichtige Merkmale des Designs von RCTs kennen und bei der Studienplanung ber&uuml;cksichtigen, die entsprechenden Analysen eigenst&auml;ndig in R durchf&uuml;hren und richtlinienkonform berichten k&ouml;nnen.</p>\n\n<p>Daher liegt ein besonderes Augenmerk des Workshops auf der Vermittlung praktischer Anwendungskenntnisse durch konkrete Beispielanalysen und Fallvignetten in R, die w&auml;hrend des Seminars eigenst&auml;ndig bearbeitet werden. Praktische &Uuml;bungen werden dabei an einem aufbereiteten, &quot;realit&auml;tsnahen&quot; Datensatz durchgef&uuml;hrt, der zu Beginn des Moduls bereitgestellt wird. Es besteht jedoch auch die M&ouml;glichkeit, eigene Forschungsdaten im Zuge der praktischen &Uuml;bungen zu analysieren, sofern diese bestimmte Voraussetzungen erf&uuml;llen.</p>\n\n<p>Ein gro&szlig;er Vorteil der R Infrastruktur liegt in der verbesserten Transparenz und Reproduzierbarkeit analytischer Ergebnisse; daher werden auch einige &quot;best practices&quot; nach den Ma&szlig;gaben von &quot;Open Science&quot; vermittelt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://workshop.mharrer.dev/workshop/rct-evaluation-in-r/\">https://workshop.mharrer.dev/workshop/rct-evaluation-in-r/</a></p>","access_right":"open","creators":[{"name":"Mathias Harrer","affiliation":"Technical University Munich"},{"name":"Janika Thielecke","affiliation":"Technical University Munich"},{"name":"Antonia Sprenger","affiliation":"University of Mageburg"}],"related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://github.com/MathiasHarrer/RCT-Analysis-With-R/tree/v1.0.1","relation":"isSupplementTo","scheme":"url"}],"version":"v1.0.1","license":"other-open","imprint_publisher":"Zenodo","upload_type":"software","prereserve_doi":{"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7791537","recid":7791537}},"title":"MathiasHarrer/RCT-Analysis-With-R: Version 1.0.1","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537","html":"https://zenodo.org/deposit/7791537","doi":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7791537","badge":"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281%2Fzenodo.7791537.svg","files":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537/files","latest_draft":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537","latest_draft_html":"https://zenodo.org/deposit/7791537","publish":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537/actions/publish","edit":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537/actions/edit","discard":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537/actions/discard","newversion":"https://zenodo.org/api/deposit/depositions/7791537/actions/newversion"},"record_id":7791537,"owner":59765,"files":[],"state":"unsubmitted","submitted":false},{"created":"2023-03-31T08:22:03.304607+00:00","modified":"2023-03-31T14:26:37.843587+00:00","id":7788019,"conceptrecid":"7782324","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7788019","conceptdoi":"10.5281/zenodo.7782324","doi_url":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7788019","metadata":{"title":"metapsy-project/data-psychosis-psyctr: Version 23.1.4","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.7788019","publication_date":"2023-03-31","description":"<strong>The <code>data-psychosis-psyctr</code> dataset</strong> 📊\n<p>The <code>data-psychosis-psyctr</code> dataset is a meta-analytic research domain <a href=\"https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf\">MARD</a> which is part of the  <a href=\"https://www.metapsy.org/\">Metapsy project</a>.
