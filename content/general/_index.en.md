Metapsy is a research project led by the VU University Amsterdam (Prof. [Pim Cuijpers]()). The goal of Metapsy is to **provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials** investigating the effect of **psychological interventions** (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various **mental disorders or mental health problems**.

#### A Unified Framework of Meta-Analytic Databases

Metapsy aims to provide a unified framework for all available meta-analytic data for these different indications. All meta-analytic databases...

* ... are created by university-based research teams using a state-of-the-art methodology and updated regularly.
* ... are formatted using an identical and transparent coding scheme.
* ... receive extensive documentation and metadata, including versioning and persistent data identifiers, following the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
* ... are made publically available via data repositories (Github, Zenodo). Researchers can also easily access the databases using the designated R package {metapsyData}.
* ... can be analyzed using state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods, either using the {metapsyTools} R package or using an [Online Meta-Analysis Tool](/meta-analysis-tool/).

Overall, the goal of the Metapsy project is to make meta-analytic psychotherapy research more transparent, flexible, and accessible. We want to facilitate a move from single, isolated meta-analyses toward a collection of **meta-analytic research domains (MARDs)**, thus benefitting both research and practice.
