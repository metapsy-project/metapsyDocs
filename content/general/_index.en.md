Metapsy is a research project led by the VU University Amsterdam (Prof. [Pim Cuijpers]()). The goal of Metapsy is to provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials investigating the effect of psychological interventions (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various mental disorders or mental health problems.

Metapsy aims to provide a **unified framework** for all available meta-analytic data for these different indications. All meta-analytic databases...

* ... are created by university-based research teams using a state-of-the-art methodology, as well as updated regularly.
* ... are formatted using an identical and transparent coding scheme.
* ... receive extensive documentation and metadata, including versioning and persistent data identifiers, following the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
