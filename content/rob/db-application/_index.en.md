The Metapsy risk of bias database application is designed for **developers and maintainers of meta-analytic databases** (particularly those adhering to the [Metapsy data standard](/data-preparation/format/)). 

{{< notice info >}}
The Risk of Bias database application can be found at [metapsy.org/rob/database-app](https://www.metapsy.org/rob/database-app/).
{{</notice>}}

The application allows for two files to be uploaded:

- ðŸ“„ **Risk of Bias Ratings**. This is an MS Excel (.xlsx) or .csv file containing risk of bias ratings for one or multiple studies. The file must strictly follow the Metapsy [RoB extraction sheet template](https://www.metapsy.org/assets/files/rob-template.xlsx), but the first five rows should be removed. An example dataset can be found [here](https://www.metapsy.org/assets/files/rob_data.xlsx).

- ðŸ“„ **Metapsy Database** (_optional_). A meta-analytic database formatted according to the [Metapsy data standard](/data-preparation/format/) (.xlsx or .csv).

{{< notice warning >}}
If both a risk of bias rating and a Metapsy database are uploaded, there should be at least one study that appears **in both datasets** (in the **"study"** column). Ensure that study names are written **exactly the same way** in both datasets. Otherwise, the studies cannot be matched.

Once at least one file is uploaded, the "<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-magic mb-0" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

<br>

After the process is completed, a **popup window** will appear. In this window, you can download the processed risk of bias rating sheet and, if applicable, the Metapsy database with added risk of bias ratings.

If both a risk of bias rating and a Metapsy database were provided, the window will also **alert you to studies that could _not_ be matched** between the two datasets.
