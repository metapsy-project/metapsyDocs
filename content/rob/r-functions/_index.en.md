This function automatically performs risk of bias ratings based on answers to the signaling questions included in the [Metapsy risk of bias tool](/rob/). If a [Metapsy database](/data-preparation/format/) is also provided, answers to some signaling questions will be [populated automatically](https://www.metapsy.org/rob/handbook/#createrobratings). Additional details can be found on the function's documentation page.
