All released Metapsy databases follow a uniform data formatting standard. This includes both the meta-analytic datasets per se, as well as the metadata provided for the data. 

Database repositories themselves also follow a pre-defined folder structure. All database objects (datasets, metadata) are provided in machine-readable formats (.csv, .json, .txt). 

Collectively, we refer to this set of data formatting and storage rules as the **Metapsy data standard**.
