All released Metapsy databases follow a uniform data formatting standard. This includes both the meta-analytic datasets per se, as well as the metadata provided for the data. 

Database repositories themselves also follow a predefined folder structure. All database objects (datasets, metadata) are provided in a machine-readable format (.csv, .json, .txt). This ensures interoperability with other Metapsy software components (e.g. the automatized [database documentation](/databases), {metapsyData}), as well as external software and programming languages in general.

Collectively, we refer to this set of data formatting and storage rules as the **Metapsy data standard**.
