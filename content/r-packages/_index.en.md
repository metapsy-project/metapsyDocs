The Metapsy infrastructure includes **two R packages**. The first package, **`metapsyData`**, allows researchers to directly access all Metapsy databases from an R environment. The second package, **`metapsyTools`**, provides state-of-the-art meta-analysis functions that can be applied to databases without any prior preprocessing steps.
