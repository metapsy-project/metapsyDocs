The Metapsy infrastructure includes **two R packages**. The first package, **`metapsyData`**, allows researchers to directly access all Metapsy databases from an R environment. The second package, **`metapsyTools`**, provides state-of-the-art meta-analysis functions that can be applied to databases without any prior preprocessing steps. Collectively, these packages create an integrated meta-analysis workflow. Using the packages:

* ðŸ“¥ the latest update or older versions of a database can be **downloaded**;
* [ðŸ‘‰](https://emojipedia.org/backhand-index-pointing-right/) databases can be **filtered** to address specific research questions;
* [ðŸ“Š](https://emojipedia.org/bar-chart/) data can be **synthesized** using a variety of meta-analytic models;
* [ðŸ“ˆ](https://emojipedia.org/chart-increasing/) meta-regression, small-study-effect and subgroup **analysis models** can be applied;
* [ðŸ“‹](https://emojipedia.org/clipboard/) **summary tables** of the results can be generated, which can easily be copied to e.g. MS Word.

#### `metapsyData`

***

The `metapsyData` package serves as an API-like interface that allows accessing the Metapsy databases from R. Using the `getData()` function, available databases can be downloaded based on their [shorthand](https://docs.metapsy.org/databases/#shorthand). The function returns an R6 `metapsyDatabase` object, which contains extensive metadata and helper functions along with the actual dataset.

The `metapsyData` package has its own documentation page, which you can find [here](https://data.metapsy.org/).

#### `metapsyTools`

***

The `metapsyTools` package facilitates the calculation of effect sizes (i.e. Hedgesâ€™ $g$ or risk ratios) and meta-analyses for data included in Metapsy databases (or databases adhering to the same format).

The package consists of **two modules**:

1. A module to check if data follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/), and to calculate effect sizes for all possible study comparisons (**preparation** module);
2. A module to select relevant comparisons for a specific meta-analysis, calculate the results (including subgroup analyses, meta-regression, small-study-effect/publication bias analyses), and generate tables (**analysis** module).

The idea is to use the two modules in different contexts. For example, the **preparation** module can be used every time the database is updated to gather all information, calculate effect sizes, and bring the data into a format suitable for further analyses.

This final dataset then builds the basis for the **analysis** module. Researchers simply have to filter out the comparisons that are relevant for their investigation, and can then use functions of the package to run a full meta-analysis.

Databases downloaded into the R environment using `metapsyData` can be analyzed "out of the box" using the analysis module in `metapsyTools`.

The `metapsyTools` package has its own documentation page, which you can find [here](https://tools.metapsy.org/).
