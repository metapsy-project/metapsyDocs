After being released, all Metapsy databases (including all released versions) can be retrieved and analyzed using two designated R packages, `metapsyData` and `metapsyTools`. We also provide a lightweight API, which can be used to export released databases and their metadata as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) objects. 

This documentation section provides further information on the two R packages, as well as the Metapsy API.
